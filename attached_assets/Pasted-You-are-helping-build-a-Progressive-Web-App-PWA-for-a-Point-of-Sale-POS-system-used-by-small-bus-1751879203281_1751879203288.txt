You are helping build a Progressive Web App (PWA) for a Point of Sale (POS) system used by small business workers and owners. The system allows workers to record sold products by tapping product images, entering quantity, entering customer payment, and automatically calculating change. Owners can upload products with images, manage data, and view analytics. For more details just analyze the replit.md However, the current design on mobile feels too zoomed-in and not user-friendly. I want you to help me improve the User Experience (UX) by refining the layout and scaling for better usability, especially on mobile devices like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. Please follow these UX improvement goals: 🔧 Layout Scaling Fix (High Priority) Ensure the mobile layout is fully responsive and does not appear zoomed-in. Use Tailwind responsive utilities to scale text (text-sm, text-base, text-xl etc.) and spacing (p-2, p-4, m-2, gap-4, etc.). Add a mobile-friendly <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> tag in index.html. Base the layout on 360–412px width screens (Galaxy reference size). 🎨 Theme System Implement a theme feature where users can switch between light mode, dark mode, or custom colors. Theme affects background, text, buttons, layout, font, etc. Use Tailwind’s custom theme support and toggle themes via a “⚙️ Settings” page. Save user theme preference using (analyze in replit.md to know what Database is use for this) per account. 🛠 UX Enhancements to Implement: Add a font-size setting (small, normal, large) for accessibility. Ensure buttons are large enough for finger tapping (min height ~44px). Create a smooth product selection workflow: Tap product → enter quantity → enter customer money → show change → auto-save sale. Add voice input (basic free option using Web Speech API) for fast product recording (e.g., “2 cola 50 pesos”). Optional: Add layout preferences (left-hand/right-hand mode). Add offline mode detection and toast feedback for saved sales. 📦 Please provide code and examples for: 1. A responsive layout template for worker’s product tap + sale entry. 2. A theme switcher system (light/dark/custom). 3. A mobile-optimized button and font-size example. The image above are what the Type of themes to apply
