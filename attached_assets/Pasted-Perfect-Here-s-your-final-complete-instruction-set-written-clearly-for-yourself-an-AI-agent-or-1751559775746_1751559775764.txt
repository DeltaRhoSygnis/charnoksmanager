✅ Final Instructions – PWA POS System (Store Workers + Owner)


---

🧠 Overview

You're building a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows:

Store Workers to quickly record sales (like a calculator)

Owners to manage product data (name, price, image)

Firebase is used for auth, Firestore for database, and Storage for images

App is hosted on Vercel and code is managed on GitHub

Future features include voice input and AI analytics

🛠 Step-by-Step Instructions


---

🔹 1. Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com


2. Enable:

Firestore

Firebase Auth

Firebase Storage



3. Copy your credentials to .env:

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...




---

🔹 2. Firestore Structure

/firestore/
├── products (owner creates)
│   └── productId
│       ├── name: string
│       ├── price: number
│       ├── imageUrl: string
│       └── createdAt: timestamp

├── sales (worker-generated)
│   └── saleId
│       ├── productId
│       ├── productName
│       ├── quantity
│       ├── price
│       ├── total
│       ├── customerPaid
│       ├── change
│       ├── workerId
│       └── timestamp

/users (Auth-linked)
│   └── userId
│       ├── name
│       ├── role: "owner" | "worker"


---

🔹 3. Authentication & Role Setup

Use Firebase Auth (email/password)

On registration, assign role in Firestore /users

Protect routes using role checks:

/worker-dashboard → only if role is worker

/owner-dashboard → only if role is owner




---

🔹 4. Owner Dashboard (Product Management)

Features:

Add product form with:

Name

Price

Upload Image (stored in Firebase Storage)


Save product info to Firestore (/products)

After adding, show all products below (editable optional)



---

🔹 5. Worker Dashboard (Sale Entry)

Features:

Display /products as image grid (like online store)

On tap:

Modal opens with:

Quantity field

Customer paid field

Auto-calculated total + change

[Confirm Sale] button



Save sale to /sales collection


Optional Additions:

Use SpeechRecognition API to allow:
“2 bread, ₱50” → parses & fills form



---

🔹 6. Hosting (Vercel)

1. Connect GitHub to Vercel


2. Push your repo


3. Add .env values in Vercel dashboard


4. Set build command:

npm run build


5. Set output directory:

.next




---

🔹 7. Future AI & Smart Features

> Add after basic version is done



Voice-to-sale form input

Auto-categorize best-selling products

Sales trends per day/week/month

Graphs using Chart.js or Recharts

🧠 Final Notes

🔐 Keep .env credentials secure

🗃️ Back up Firebase and Firestore data regularly

🧪 Test on mobile devices — workers may use phones

🔁 Allow product updates (name, price) from Owner side

✅ Add search bar/filter if your product list grows

Would you like me to:

Export this as a printable README.md?

Start generating the component files?

Or draw a UI layout (mockup) for workers?


Let me know what comes next — you're very close to launching a great tool.
