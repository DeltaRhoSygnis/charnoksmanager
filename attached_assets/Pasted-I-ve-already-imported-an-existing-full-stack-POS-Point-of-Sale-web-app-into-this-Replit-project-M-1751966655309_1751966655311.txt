I’ve already imported an existing full-stack POS (Point of Sale) web app into this Replit project.
My system is not new — it’s already built with:

React (frontend)

Tailwind CSS (for styling)

Firebase Auth (user authentication)

Express + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (backend logic and data handling)


🔁 I just need help reviewing, completing, and fixing existing backend data logic for:

Sales

Expenses

Dashboard/Analytics (Charts, Graphs, KPI)



---

✅ SYSTEM IS ALREADY SET UP:

All files are in place (client, server, database, routing).

Firebase is used only for authentication.

Supabase/PostgreSQL is the main database using Drizzle ORM.

Express routes are under /api/....

Frontend uses TanStack Query to fetch data.
The app works on Replit, and has working UI and auth.

For more details just go to Replit.md


---

❗ CURRENT PROBLEM TO FIX:

Owner Dashboard and Analysis components are not showing correct data (blank charts, empty stats).

I suspect the API routes for fetching sales/expenses aren’t wired to the Drizzle database properly.

I need to confirm whether the API is:

Querying the PostgreSQL database correctly using Drizzle

Returning usable data formats to the frontend

Matching the role-based or UID-based filters (e.g. only fetching for current user)

🔧 TASKS FOR YOU:

1. Review backend API routes related to sales, expenses, summary, dashboard, or analysis.


2. Verify Drizzle queries – make sure they connect to Supabase/PostgreSQL and return expected results.


3. Fix or create working API endpoints for:



Total Sales

Expenses

Profit

Charts for Top Products, Time Patterns, KPIs


4. Ensure frontend pages (like /dashboard, /analysis) are receiving correct data.




---

✅ Important:

Don’t change or delete existing working parts like Firebase Auth, Product Image Upload, or UI code.

Don’t reset or start over — just help connect/fix/refactor what’s already here.

Let me know where the issue is (API, DB query, frontend mapping), and suggest specific code fixes or additions.
